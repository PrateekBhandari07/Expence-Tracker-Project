# üí∞ Expense Tracker (Serverless Architecture)

A full-stack serverless expense tracking application that enables users to manage their daily expenses and visualize their spending patterns. Built using modern AWS services, this project includes a responsive frontend and a scalable, event-driven backend with automatic email alerts when spending crosses a defined threshold.

---

## üìù Project Description

This Expense Tracker allows users to **add, update, delete, and view expenses**, while also displaying a **real-time bar chart** summary by category. The app leverages **AWS Lambda** as the backend, with **API Gateway** as the REST interface and **DynamoDB** for storage. When a user‚Äôs total expenses exceed **‚Çπ10,000**, an alert is triggered and sent via **AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service)** as an email notification.

The frontend is a single-page application built with **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Chart.js**, hosted as a static site on **Amazon S3**.

4. Enable **public access** to files.
5. Set index document: `index.html`
6. Access your frontend using the S3 website endpoint.

### üîß Backend (AWS Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB + SNS)

#### 1. **Create a DynamoDB Table**
- **Table Name**: `Expense`
- **Partition Key**: `userId` (String)
- **Sort Key**: `expenseId` (String)

#### 2. **Create SNS Topic**
- Create a topic (e.g., `ExpenseAlerts`)
- Subscribe your email (confirm it via mail)
- Copy the **Topic ARN**

#### 3. **Create the Lambda Function**
- Runtime: Python 3.9+
- Use the `lambda_function.py` (from `backend/`) as the source code.
- Set environment variables or hardcode `SNS_TOPIC_ARN` and `userId`.

#### 4. **Attach Permissions**
- Attach policies for:
  - `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess`
  - `AmazonSNSFullAccess`
  - `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`

#### 5. **Create API Gateway**
- Create a **REST API** (HTTP API also works).
- Define the following endpoints:
  - `POST /expenses` ‚Üí Add expense
  - `GET /expenses` ‚Üí Get all expenses
  - `PUT /expenses/{id}` ‚Üí Update expense
  - `DELETE /expenses/{id}` ‚Üí Delete expense
- Integrate each route with the Lambda.

#### 6. **Enable CORS**
Ensure all methods in API Gateway have:
```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
